        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            <span>Hello I'm Natasha </span> I have always found an interest in design. However, I never got the chance to explore this interest of mine till high school was done. I studied Interactive and Visual Design in Brisbane, Australia and found an interest in Visual Identity, branding and UI design. I also enjoy portrait photography in my free time and have completed a few photography projects myself. Furthermore, I also did a minor in Advertising (business) which helped me immensely with the branding aspect of design.
